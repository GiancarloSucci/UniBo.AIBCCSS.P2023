    ``Often it appears that a pestilential epidemic has plagued the humankind in the aspect that characterizes it the most: the use of the word, a pest of the language that manifests itself as \textcolor{red}{\textbf{loss of cognitive strength}} and of spontaneity, as an \textcolor{blue}{\textbf{automation of forms}} that tend to level expressions toward more generic, anonymous, and abstract formulations, to smooth down crisp expressions, to turn off any sparkle arising when old words occurs in new circumstances."

\begin{itemize}
\item Writing has to satisfy two, apparently divergent, constraints:

\item on the other side, the ability to \textcolor{blue}{express in limited space} such complexity, without compromising the precision.
\end{itemize} \vspace{0.2cm}
\item The solution for this dilemma is \textcolor{red}{not to ``fill pages with words''} in a humongous effort to put in places all such details, \begin{itemize}
\item rather to separate what is \textcolor{red}{expressed with words} and what is \textcolor{blue}{expressed with omissions}.

\begin{tcolorbox}[fonttitle=\bfseries,nobeforeafter,center title,colback=yellow!5,colframe=yellow!40!black,title=Impossibility to Generalize]
In reality, always my writing has found itself in front of \textcolor{red}{two divergent ways that correspond to two different kinds of knowledge}: \textcolor{blue}{one that moves itself in the mental space of unbundled rationality}, where we can draw lines that interconnect points, projections, abstract forms, vector of forces; \textcolor{orange}{the other that moves itself in a space full of objects} and tries to create an equivalent verbal of the space filling pages with words $\ldots{}$ They are \textcolor{cyan}{two different compulsions toward precision that will never arrive to the absolute satisfaction} $\ldots{}$ I oscillate continuously between these two ways and when I feel to have completely explored the possibility of one I jump to the other, and viceversa.

\begin{itemize}
\item Vagueness has a  positive connotation for many poets;
\begin{itemize}
\item because it allows to \textcolor{red}{perceive with a high level of precision} \textcolor{red}{the indetermination} (notice the oxymoron)  of several situations
\item G. Leopardi: ``To this pleasure contributes the variety,  \textcolor{red}{the uncertainty}, the fact that we cannot see everything, and so  \textcolor{blue}{we can elaborate with our imagination what we cannot see}.''
\end{itemize}
\item Usually, it generates a negative feeling while writing software, but what about:
\begin{itemize}
\item variables with names \texttt{i} or \texttt{j}
\item overloading of names
\item overriding of names
\item $\ldots{}$

\begin{itemize}
\item A related concept is the appreciation of the \textcolor{red}{impossibility of generalizing}
\begin{itemize}
\item there are situations that appear to be absolutely unique
\item R. Musil: ``There are mathematical problems for which  \textcolor{red}{a general solution does not exist} but rather individual solutions, that, together, approach the general solution.''
\item G. Flaubert `` \textcolor{blue}{The good Lord is in the details}.''
\end{itemize}
\item Being specific is essential to avoid the temptation of generalizing and abstracting
\item The poet should describe one facet of a crystal representing the reality, where every side of the crystal provides a different and complementary views of it.
\begin{itemize}
\item This resonates a bit with agile but it is a concept with potentials still to express.

{\centerline{Visibility}}

\begin{tcolorbox}[fonttitle=\bfseries,nobeforeafter,center title,colback=yellow!5,colframe=yellow!40!black,title=Vision]
The process by which the fantasy elaborates images of sensations and feelings. What happens when Dante says: ``\textcolor{red}{It rained inside the high fantasy}.'' and ``\textcolor{blue}{Oh imagination, you who capture our attention so strongly that even 1000 trumpets could not distract us from you, who move moves you even when what our senses do not instruct you?}'' 
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{itemize}
\item Visibility plays a dual role in understanding:
\begin{itemize}
\item when we provide a visual representation of the reality;
\item  when we see an image and we reconstruct the reality in a verbal form.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Images are often generated telling stories and

    \item stories are generated from images.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The narration is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a tool \textcolor{red}{to understand},
    \item and a way \textcolor{blue}{to provide additional insights} and ask for an additional understanding,
    \item but importantly  also as a \textcolor{orange}{collection of possible hypotheses of what could be}.
\end{itemize}
\item Images will evolve:
\begin{itemize}
    \item being \textcolor{cyan}{standardized}
    \item \textcolor{red}{revising completely the creation process}, especially for new and more challenging tasks.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The approach by Calvino/Dante is a \textit{de-facto} standard
    \item The dual role of visibility in understanding occurs in several parts of the development process -- \textcolor{red}{roundtrip engineering}
    \item Visibility facilitates agility through the creation of vivid images of what we are developing:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item consider the example of \textcolor{blue}{metaphors}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Narration has exactly the same role for visibility
    \item Also the future of images appears to resonate:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item We are spectators of the process of standardizing images
    \item In several fields we see a restart of the process of generating images, e.g., in dashboarding, business analytics, etc.

\begin{itemize}
\item Calvino outlines two possible interpretations of the process of building representations of the world:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{red}{as communication of internal state of minds}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{as emergence of knowledge archetypes} 
\end{itemize}
These concepts are practically new in writing SW but they appear to have strong potentials. \vspace{0.3cm}
\item Calvino promotes a pedagogy of imagination that could be very relevant for SW writers.

\begin{tcolorbox}[fonttitle=\bfseries,nobeforeafter,center title,colback=yellow!5,colframe=yellow!40!black,title=Ambition of Literature]
Excessive ambitions can be blamed in many areas of human endeavours, but not in literature. \textcolor{red}{The literature lives only if it sets humongous objective's}, even beyond what is conceivable. Only if poets and writers will aim at achieving enterprises that  none else even dare to dream the literature will continue to have a purpose. At the time at which the science is wary of general explanations and of solutions that are not sectorial and specialized, \textcolor{blue}{the big challenge for literature is to be able to weave together the different knowledge and the different codes within a plural and multifaceted view of the world.}

        \item there is a tendency of provide a plenitude of details, and
        \item there is an approach to minimize the possible information flow 
    \end{itemize}
    \item There is a large amount of \textcolor{orange}{writers that did not complete (some of) their works}, e.g., Virgilio (Latin, 70BC-20BC), Dante (Italian, 1265-1321), Goethe (German, 1748-1832), Proust (French, 1871-1922), $\ldots{}$

\begin{itemize}
    \item Four classes, wrt multiplicity:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item texts following a \textcolor{red}{single inspiration, but that can then be understood at multiple levels};
        \item works where \textcolor{blue}{multiple narrations} intersect strongly within a well defined context, but without providing an overall unifying vision;
        \item  attempts to create a \textcolor{orange}{single and unifying vision} of the whole work, that then is very likely to never be completed;
        \item collections of \textcolor{cyan}{non contradictory aphorisms}, which do not give a comprehensive and explicit view of the subject of discussion, but shed lights on aspects of it
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}   
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
{\centerline{Multiplicity in SW}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Also in SW there are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  methods that attempt to create comprehensive models of the systems to develop;
        \item  alternative ideas that software should be minimalistically designed. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Especially when developed using waterfalls, software development exhibits the natural tendency of never ending
    \item Software is also exposed at the expansion of its original intention well beyond the initial ideas, as it is evident for instance in the history of PowerPoint
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
{\centerline{Multiplicity in SW}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The four classes exist (with modification):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textcolor{red}{single inspiration but multiple interpretations}: this reflects the idea of describing a system as a set of different and coherent views, as it was done, for instance, in the mid-90s with the methodologies developed around the newly defined UML;
        \item \textcolor{blue}{multiple narrations} proceeding in parallel: this appears to be quite present in agent-based systems;
        \item \textcolor{orange}{single and universal description}: this is what happens when we try to build an omni-comprehensive system;
        \item collection of \textcolor{cyan}{non contradictory simple models}: this resembles strongly agile methods collecting requirements in the forms of simple users stories and then developing incrementally.

    \end{itemize} \vspace{0.2cm}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item open source communities have created software based on \textcolor{orange}{various contributions of different
